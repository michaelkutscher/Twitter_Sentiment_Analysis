# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis
This repository contains sentiment analysis with data fetched from twitter users. 

I removed my twitter developer credentials. 
Therefore, if you want to reproduce this sentiment analysis on your own, you have to get your own developer credentials from twitter.

Sign up for a twitter developer account and create an app to get your credentials.
https://developer.twitter.com/en

You have to insert the credentials in the .csv-file contained in this repository. The python script then refers to this .csv-file to get your API-credentials.
